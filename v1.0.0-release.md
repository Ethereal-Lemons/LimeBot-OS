# 🍋 LimeBot-OS v1.0.0-beta

First public beta release of LimeBot-OS — a self-hosted, agentic AI assistant built on Gemini with multi-channel support, persistent memory, and a real-time web dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **LimeBot-OS is currently in Beta.** While it supports multiple providers via LiteLLM, it is optimized for and **works best with Google Gemini** (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash`).

## ✨ Features

### Core
- Agentic loop with tool use — file operations, command execution, web browsing, memory search
- Persistent semantic memory via LanceDB with background distillation into `MEMORY.md`
- Multi-session context isolation
- Cron/reminder scheduler
- Skill system — extend LimeBot-OS with custom Python/Node skills, each with their own dependencies and LLM instructions
- Git-based skill installer

### Channels
- **Web dashboard** — real-time chat UI with WebSocket streaming, built in React + Vite + shadcn/ui
- **Discord** — full slash command support (`/status`, `/persona`, `/clear_memory`), tool confirmation buttons, auto-reactions, message threading
- **WhatsApp** — bridge connector with autonomous mode

### Dashboard
- Live streaming chat with typing indicators and tool progress embeds
